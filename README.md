parts-of-speech
===============

This app uses the 230,000 entry parts-of-speech catalog from the [Moby Project](http://icon.shef.ac.uk/Moby/). The catalog is parsed and sorted by Node.js into a data object. For each part of speech a function is rendered that displays the results of the cross-reference of the words in the text area and the words in the database for that part of speech. The effect is that, as the user types, the words instantly appear on the right side of the screen next to the label for their part of speech.

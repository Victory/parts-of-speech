parts-of-speech
===============

This app uses the 230,000 entry parts-of-speech catalog from the [Moby Project](http://icon.shef.ac.uk/Moby/). The catalog is parsed and sorted by Node.js into a data object. For each part of speech, a function is rendered that displays the results of the cross-reference of the words in the text area and the words in the database for that part of speech.
